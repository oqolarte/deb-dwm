dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

Also, these programs are integrated into this build, so you might want
to make sure that add/delete them in your system, or edit in the
config.h

- newsboat
- thunderbird
- signal-desktop
- tabbed (suckless)
- surf (suckless)
- slock (suckless)
- scrot
- firefox


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
